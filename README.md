## Summary
 Our project is to build an application based on Android platform. :bowtie:
 
 This app is for people like students to detect handwritten characters by simply taking a picture or chosing photos from album. Then we convert handwritten characters to editable text :smirk::smirk::smirk:
 
 Also, since not everyone has proficiency of English, we can provide a function of translation. So that after detecting characters, we translate the sentences or passages to specific language, which means users can understand the context better.We build the link to Google translate to accomplish our translation function. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
