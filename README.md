Summary

Our project is to build an application based on Android platform. :bowtie:

This app is for people like students to detect handwritten characters by simply taking a picture or chosing photos from album. Then we convert handwritten characters to editable text 😏😏😏

Also, since not everyone has proficiency of English, we can provide a function of translation. So that after detecting characters, we translate the sentences or passages to specific language, which means users can understand the context better.We build the link to Google translate to accomplish our translation function. 😝😝😝

Get Started

Step 1

If you would like to run our application, the first thing is to download Android Studio if you haven't done it.

Then if you have installed git, you can use the command

git clone https://github.com/wym613/BlingBling.git
to download our project. Instead of that, you can also download from our github website.

After importing our project, you can use Emulator or your own Android device to run our application.

Step 2

Since we imported Google Translate as part of our application, you need to install 'Google Translate' on your Android device or on Emulator.

For Android devices, you can access to Google Translate in Google Play App Store.

For Emulator, you need to download google translate .apk file first.
